What ETF's are widely diversified with a low expense ratio given the macro-economic enviroment factors that can provide me a aggresive mix of International and domestic US returns. Risk Tolerance at Medium with a horizon of 10 years of investing.

Ideally, given your situation you have a larger risk tolerance for this time horizon - for a strategy such as this I'd consider VT type funds given the holdings are larger than traditional VTI funds and includes international markets while allowing diversification on a larger scale or you can consider VTI, VXUS for two funds however be advised on expense ratios can increase as opposed to having one fund.
